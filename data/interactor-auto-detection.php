 * Auto-detection data for supported classes with existing interactors.

 * Because array indexing is much more efficient and performant than other methods (e.g.
 * searching all the array for a specific value), and also because the main handler of
 * auto-detection is the provider class name (along with its namespace), the first depth
 * of the array contains key-value pairs, in which, the keys are the provider name, and
 * the values is an array of mapping functionalities into prefered interactors.

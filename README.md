## Why Json?

### Performance

Thinking of performance? Json is here. Many methods have been tested to perform as fast as they could. Sometimes, they are faster than internals. Really? Test it yourself!

### Flexible and Customizable

Json is not only for JSON data. So what?

- Many types are supported, including JSON strings, arrays, objects and scalars (+ null). Resources are not supported. 
- Use methods regardless of the data type. Merging two objects? Actually.
- Do anything, even if not provided by the class, using a callable. Alternatives? Extend from the class and define your own things. For sure, it will be easy in both cases.
- Not only a single way to do a job. Many ways.
- Oh, what if an index does not exist? Exception. Parsing bad JSON data? Exception, again. Warnings and notices? Very rare cases.

JSON is a class that provides tools to manage your data in JSON format. You can use it as array or object handler, and make type conversions between these three types (JSON, array, object). The indexes, for example, can be accessed using nested keys, separated by dots (e.g. apps.browsers.chrome).

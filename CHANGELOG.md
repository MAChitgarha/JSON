# Json Package Changelog

## 2.0.0

**Note:** You see many backward incompatibility changes. The reason is, the purpose of Json package was changed since this version, and the code was rewritten almost completely.

### 2.0.0-alpha.1

#### Added

-   Add interaction layers as interfaces between feature providers and Json class.

#### Backward Incompatibility

##### Changed

-   Change the whole namespace hierarchy. Everything is now under `MAChitgarha\Json` namespace, and all namespaces are now in plural form (e.g., `Component` converted to `Components`).

**Note:** This changelog was added from version 2.0.0. For older changelog, refer to the commit messages or the release notes.
